# ts-esm-babel-template
Because I don't want to look up the preset-env arguments<br/>
and guess for two hours until getting it right, again.

## Function
This repo is set up to use babel 7^<br/>
to compile typescript to javascript esmodules<br/>

Simply run:
`npm run build` or `./build.sh`

File copy is set up as well.

`src/index.ts` -> `lib/index.js`<br/>
`src/index.html` -> `lib/index.html`

If you feel this template could be made better,<br/>
submit a PR and I'll merge if its pretty + works :)
